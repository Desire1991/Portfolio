        <p>
          <b>Brittney ¬∑ QA Engineer at Salient Systems</b>
        </p>
        Desire was a great asset to his team during the time we worked together at Salient Systems. Navigating unfamiliar 
        territory and finding our own way, Desire was able to successfully Develope and execute clean test cases for both our Manual and automation team, using a variety of both familiar
        the new/familiar automation tools within the company. It's clear he has a real passion for forward thinking best practices in Quality Assurance and 
        was a thought leader on the team, when it came to how we would evolve our technology to true CI/CD processes and tech.
        When faced with a challenge or problem to solve, Desire doesn't back down or give up easily, and stays focused on the prize
        until he is successful. He is a real team player that his peers can count on to deliver.
        <p>

          <b>Gilbert Ndayambaje ¬∑ Senior Software Engineer at Amazon</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Desire is an incredibly talented Software QA engineer, the speed at which he not only learns but master new technologies is
          impressive. His work ethic is outstanding, and he always delivers! We were in a transformation as a software
          company and required the team to wear many hats and be able to adapt to new technologies quickly; Desire was an
          essential part of this transformation, and he never wavered.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Josh ¬∑ DevOps Engineer at CTIntegrations</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          I can't say enough good things about Desire. He's driven, positive and committed. He brightens up a room when he
          walks in and stays focused approaching any situation or problem. He keeps an open mind when troubleshooting and
          tries to look at things from different angles when stuck, which leads to unique and inventive solutions. It was
          an absolute pleasure working with Desire and any company would be improved having him on their payroll.
